Inheritance 

when we construct a new class from existing class in such a way that the new class access all the methods of other class .

Extends -> is the keyword that can help us use Inheritance


code :-

class a 
{

}

class b extends abstract  // after using extend keyword, it can be used do inherit 
{

}

always make , the sub class as object which inheits class ;

example here "b" will be the sub class ;


There types of classes that :- 

1> simple Inheritance class
2> Multi level Inheritance class
3> Muntiple Inheritance class
